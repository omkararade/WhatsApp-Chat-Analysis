03/06/2023, 14:24 - santosh (DT): *Saturday - 3/6/2023*

*Efforts and contributions*

PPT created
- 1 student presentation

Sessions moderated/co-moderated
- 2 student preparation sessions on Zoom
- 1 SVIT lab session 
- 1 SVIT auditorium session 

Presentations given
- 1 at SVIT on Wednesday
- 1 at St. Mary‚Äôs on Friday

Ppt reviewed and modified
- 1 self-reflection presentation 

Curriculum design
- Documented about 12 drills for SEL and Learnability
- Documented 1 plan for our future assessments 

*Learnings*

1. It‚Äôs best to start a presentation with outcomes and then talk about the processes followed because outcomes get readers to desire the processes followed.

2. When students are shown purpose and they connect with it, they are more likely to take action to meet it.
- *Outcome:* When Pardhu connected with the purpose of LDI, he raised his hand to pitch during the LDI.

3. When abstract concepts are broken down into simple questions, students are more likely to take part in the discussion and arrive at their own answers.
- *Outcome:* When I asked students of SVIT to imagine a clothing website and how they would make it amazing, instead of going into HTML, CSS, or Js at first, about 75% of the students discussed and gave their own ideas, which were connected to web dev.

4. While giving a presentation about the outcomes achieved to evoke interest in students to take up web development, the students who achieved are more important in your presentations than you are, so speak of their outcomes, take their names, make it about them, not you. This way, students genuinely feel that if their friends can achieve it, so can they.

5. It is important that we conduct frequent reviews of our work so that last-minute rework can be avoided.
- For example, in a PPT that talks about self-reflection, I brought in the Feynman technique, which is harder to connect with self-reflection. Last-minute changes had to be made, which was anxiety-inducing.

6. It is best to discuss what other teams are doing and reflect on their work. This paves the way for collaborations.
- For example, for our web dev. For assignments, we used the help of the data science team to integrate ChatGPT in the evaluation process. This would not have been possible had we not known what the DS team was doing.

7. I learned a new drill which is writing a thank-you letter to yourself. By doing so, I felt more hopeful for myself. Some letters are as follows:
- Hey! You did not need anybody or anything to drive you to start your day. You woke up on your own, took care of yourself, and got to the presentation‚Äîyou have been independent today :)

- Hey! You had fun-filled conversations with your colleagues and the students of SVIT. It is you who chose to have these conversations. You have been a socially-healthy person today :) 

- Hey! You handled a presentation on the spot today, and that was spontaneous of you! Kudos to you! Spontaneity can drive innovation! :)

*Unlearnings*

1. While giving a presentation about the outcomes of our program, let me not showcase my knowledge, instead, let me showcase the processes followed, giving examples of how they helped my students achieve their outcomes. This way, students are more likely to find our contributions genuine.

*Bottlenecks*

1. Travel to SVIT was time-taking and tiring, which slowed down our progress when it comes to creating the curriculum and reviewing student presentations.

*Celebrations*

1. @917002110273 took ample responsibility this week, creating the curriculum, and taking care of the technology during our presentations almost singlehandedly! He is appreciated for these contributions!

2. I got a life-changing unlearning this week about how I present to students. I am looking forward to implementing them in the near future.

3. I learned about and practiced writing a thank-you letter to myself. This drill made me genuinely feel very good about myself. I am looking forward to practicing this more often.

07/07/2023, 10:36 - santosh (DT): @‚Å®Bhargav Krishna‚Å© 
Our AVP Shagun Mishra has told us that she wishes to go back to Varanasi because of a mental burnout
She feels that she is not productive here despite working for 12hours a day

*Reason:*
She has to solve the accomodation, food and other issues of people here
after handling DT projects and ensuring smooth execution of JSMIES

The team leads Santosh and Tanuj did not eat for 2days. I got food
from outside yesterday and made sure everyone ate.
The mess staff do not still understand the importance of the team here
Tanuj is still carrying the trauma of being shouted at.

I suggest that we go a little slow on projects now. 
The training programme and the young CTO programme are going well
We will build strength there till 17th and then discuss any further work

My biggest priority right now is to work on the team morale
in the absence of Shagun.

Prakash Sir is on it.
[7/27, 11:05 PM] Bhargav Krishna: SVIT update.
[7/27, 11:21 PM] Tarun Sciensation: Srinivas sir will look into it. Harsha sir has asked him to resolve it

Srinivas sir was not aware of the accommodation issue. He has proposed some really good alternatives. 

Hilton will meet him

I am confident that Srinivas sir will find an alternative tomorrow itself. 

I have asked the team to stay there

14/08/2023, 09:30 - Shubhodeep DT: It has been really a wonderful journey with DeepThought. From knowing nothing at all to leading a team of 8 people at the time of releasing. I'm glad to get an opportunity to share my learning via this journal which will act as a reflection of my whole journey in DeepThought. First and foremost, I learnt how to work in a team. In a team where the members belong to different parts of the country, it was very challenging for us all and for me to learn to deal with people with different mindset and people having different work-ethic. 
The first day when the company's CEO, Mr.Tarun gave an orientation, he gave an emballished speech on the vision of the St.marys college and the students with whom we'll be working with. He shared different pedagojies of teaching complex Software Engineering topics. 
One of them which he introduced us with was "The Fyenman Technique". He introduced this technique to all the newly hires of which I was also a part of it. The techniques was named after a famous American Physicist 'Richard Fyenman'. He proposed a pedagogy which said that, "If you could explain a topic to a 5 yr. old, only then you have understood a topic to its fundamentals". 
We even got an implementation of the "Fyenman Technique" in understanding the Frontend-Backend cycle. Tarun used the example of 'Karachi bakery' to be the 'Server' and we as a user/customer of the bakery. I also understood the value of 'Unlearning things' which is a very key factor for a developer as well as for a Data Scientist. We also got to know the importance of 'Unlearning and Re-Learning things'. This is a beautifull process which was given light by Tarun. 
He explained about it by saying that When our thoughts turn towards the concept of learning, they frequently navigate the landscape of content‚Äîthe intricate tapestry of facts and concepts that adorns specific domains of knowledge, be it the intricate annals of history, the enigmatic theories of physics, or the depths of psychological insights. Indeed, a significant portion of scholarly exploration has been dedicated to unraveling the intricate relationship between prior knowledge and the process of learning, often spotlighting the context of conceptual misinterpretations that tend to arise within the scientific disciplines.

While the cornerstone of learning seems to rest upon the acquisition of "declarative knowledge," which encompasses the realm of understanding 'what' something is, it is vital to recognize that this is not the sole arena of learning's influence. Just as the firmament of the night sky conceals innumerable stars, there exists a vast expanse of "procedural knowledge" alongside declarative knowledge, defining the art of comprehending 'how' things are done.

Procedural knowledge stands as the repository of skills and techniques that empower individuals to deftly manipulate and interact with information across diverse scenarios. Whether it's the elegant choreography of solving intricate mathematical problems, the seamless orchestration of emergency protocols during crises, or the harmonious execution of strategic plays on the football field, procedural knowledge guides our actions. Unlike its declarative counterpart, this form of knowledge often resides beneath the surface of conscious awareness, silently steering our responses and actions.
Venturing further, the tendrils of learning entwine themselves with our attitudes, reflections, and behaviors. Our perspectives, shaped by our beliefs, cast a substantial shadow on our interactions with the learning journey. Consider students who perceive learning as an inherent trait, attributing success to natural aptitude rather than concerted effort. Such a disposition can impede their resilience in the face of challenges, discouraging diligent endeavor in the wake of adversity.

To encapsulate, the panorama of learning encompasses not only the realm of factual knowledge and theoretical understanding but also the art of skillful application and the intricate dance of attitudes and behaviors. As we traverse this multifaceted landscape, we unravel the intertwined threads of declarative and procedural knowledge, intricately woven with our perceptions and reactions. Gaining a holistic grasp of learning necessitates embracing its diverse dimensions, thereby fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricate symphony that shapes our journey towards knowledge and growth.

In DeepThought we learnt about various technology aspects. We got mentored and teaching from one of the talented developers in the company. They are Shawan Mandal. He is a Full Stack Developer in DeepThought. He explaines this in the best way a Intern should learn. He uses 'Fyenman Technique' to explain most of the complicated topics in the tech area. He introduced us with the technology named 'NodeBB' which is a next-generation discussion platform that utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. NodeBB forums have many modern features out of the box such as social network integration and streaming discussions, as well as a full REST API and plugin framework for full third-party extensibility.
NodeBB is an open source project which can be forked on GitHub. NodeBB uses Transifex, which is a user friendly visual tool which allows any individual to translate text into a language of their choice.
We also got to learn from the Principle Software Developer at DeepThought, named, Alex. He is  also a Fullstack Developer. His teaching procedure is soo intuitive that even a person who is not into tech, will be able to relate it to it without having any prier kno;edge about the topics. He took a lot of sessions and trained us in various technologies. One such was jQuery. The jQuery itself has a slogan, "Write less, Do more". He tooks session on jQuery explanation and explained things in a very smooth manner by which a new joinee won't ever feel lost in the tech. industry. He also demonstrated several best practices of HTML & CSS which a new joinee is not really aware of. His sessions a pure learning and each of his explanations consisted of plenty of examples. We also got to learn about Figma application when I got a task to make a webpage to make in one of the main projecct of DeepThought. I learned Figma with the assistance of the UI/UX team members of DT. 
Apart from the Tech part, DeepThought has taught us one of the key factors to main tain Work-Life Balance at work. Tarun introduced us to "Emotional Inteligence". Emotional intelligence, often referred to as EQ, finds its definition in the prowess to comprehend and navigate one's own emotional landscape adeptly. In addition, it involves the perceptive ability to identify and wield an impact upon the emotions held by individuals in one's proximity. This nuanced concept emerged into the lexicon, its origins attributed to the collaborative efforts of researchers John Mayer and Peter Salovey. However, the limelight truly fell upon it when psychologist Daniel Goleman propelled its recognition into mainstream discourse.
In this rendition, the focus remains on the statement made by Tarun, while the surrounding context provides a more elaborative perspective on the topic of emotional intelligence.
Lacking critical emotional skills can lead to workplace conflict, such as misunderstandings due to an inability to recognize or understand emotions.
One of the most common indicators of low emotional intelligence is difficulty managing and expressing emotions. You might struggle with acknowledging colleagues' concerns appropriately or wrestle with active listening. Consider the relationships you have with your co-workers. Are your conversations strained? Do you repeatedly blame others when projects don‚Äôt go as planned? Are you prone to outbursts? These are all signs of a lack of emotional intelligence. It's important to cultivate social skills by understanding and practicing empathy and the core components of emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence is typically broken down into four core competencies:
Self-awareness
Self-management
Social awareness
Relationship management

Self-awareness is at the core of everything. It describes your ability to not only understand your strengths and weaknesses, but to recognize your emotions and their effect on you and your team‚Äôs performance. To bring out the best in others, you first need to bring out the best in yourself, which is where self-awareness comes into play. One easy way to assess your self-awareness is by completing 360-degree feedback, in which you evaluate your performance and then match it up against the opinions of your boss, peers, and direct reports. 
Self-management refers to the ability to manage your emotions, particularly in stressful situations, and maintain a positive outlook despite setbacks. Leaders who lack self-management tend to react and have a harder time keeping their impulses in check. A reaction tends to be automatic. The more in tune you are with your emotional intelligence, however, the easier you can make the transition from reaction to response. It's important to pause, breathe, collect yourself, and do whatever it takes to manage your emotions‚Äîwhether that means taking a walk or calling a friend‚Äîso that you can more appropriately and intentionally respond to stress and adversity. 
While it‚Äôs important to understand and manage your own emotions, you also need to know how to read a room. Social awareness describes your ability to recognize others‚Äô emotions and the dynamics in play within your organization.
Leaders who excel in social awareness practice empathy. They strive to understand their colleagues‚Äô feelings and perspectives, which enables them to communicate and collaborate more effectively with their peers.
Relationship management refers to your ability to influence, coach, and mentor others, and resolve conflict effectively.
Some prefer to avoid conflict, but it‚Äôs important to properly address issues as they arise. Research shows that every unaddressed conflict can waste about eight hours of company time in gossip and other unproductive activities, putting a drain on resources and morale.
Leaders set the tone of their organization. If they lack emotional intelligence, it could have more far-reaching consequences, resulting in lower employee engagement and a higher turnover rate.

We also got exposed to one of the very eye-opening theories of Life which is, "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs". Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem and self-Actualization. Our most basic need is for physical survival, and this will be the first thing that 
motivates our behavior. Once that level is fulfilled the next level up is what motivates us, and so on. The original hierarchy of needs five-stage model includes: 
1. Physiological needs - these are biological requirements for Human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, sleep. If these needs are not satisfied the human body cannot function optimally. Maslow considered physiological needs the most important as all the other needs become secondary until these needs are met. 
2. Safety needs - protection from elements, security, order, law, stability, freedom from fear.
3. Love and belongingness needs - after physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social and involves feelings of belongingness. The need for interpersonal relationships motivates behavior Examples include friendship, intimacy, trust, and acceptance, receiving and giving affection and love. Affiliating, being part of a group (family, friends, work).
4. Esteem needs - which Maslow classified into two categories: (i) esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence) and (ii) the desire for reputation or respect from others (e.g., status, prestige). Maslow indicated that the need for respect or reputation is most important for children and adolescents and precedes real self-esteem or dignity. 
5.Self-actualization needs - realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences. A desire ‚Äúto 
become everything one is capable of becoming‚Äù.

And the last aspect which hold one of the primary role in a person's life is the "Business prospects of Life". One of the best practices which DT conducts id the weekly LDI's in which people take initiative to share their leadership strategies regarding several topics which is shared a day before when the LDI is about to take place. One of the many topic is "Brand Positioning". Brand positioning refers to the unique value that a brand presents to its customer. It is a marketing strategy brands create to establish their brand identity while conveying their value proposition, which is the reason why a customer would prefer their brand over others. Additionally, brand positioning is used when a company wants to position themselves in a certain way to their audiences in order for customers to create associations between the brand and its value proposition.
Another very important Business topic was "Design Thinking" . Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Involving five phases‚ÄîEmpathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test‚Äîit is most useful to tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown. Design thinking‚Äôs value as a world-improving, driving force in business (global heavyweights such as Google, Apple and Airbnb have wielded it to notable effect) matches its status as a popular subject at leading international universities. With design thinking, teams have the freedom to generate ground-breaking solutions. Using it, your team can get behind hard-to-access insights and apply a collection of hands-on methods to help find innovative answers.
Another such valuable topic which took part several times in Saturdays is "Product Mindset". In this constantly evolving world; research, IT and manufacturing segments have well adopted the culture of continuous learning. This has shown significant improvements in their product success and customer delight. Routine life examples of Utility Phone to Smartphone and Ford to Tesla are the results of such evolutions. Especially, IT and dependent sub sectors have shown tremendous cultural shift in last two decades. One of the most important shifts is in the approach of thinking, executing and delivering solutions. I.e. the shift from Project Mindset to Product Mindset. Product mindset is about building a product centric thought process rather than temporary milestone-based release approach. It‚Äôs about thinking and working in the direction of quicker business outcomes. When the higher focus is on the business and the end product; objective of customer centricity strongly emerges. And to achieve this goal of customer savvy product; the entire team works together from Day One.
With this I would like to conclude with my journal of the learnings in DeepThought, a company which has played a vital role in my career, giving me a great opportunity to learn, un-Learn, relearn and to understand things in the best way possible. It is the company which gave me the ability of meta-cognition thinking and Self-Introspection. The regular practice of sharing reflections on minor/major discussions helped me to think from all perspectives and to empathizes with people's feeling and emotions. Thankyou for this opportunity and I would like to conclude with my journal by thanking the company with warm regards for giving me such amazing life lessons.

14/08/2023, 23:06 - santosh (DT): My tenure at Deep Thought has been an incredible journey of personal and professional growth, marked by a transformative evolution from a learner to a confident and proactive leader. This journal encapsulates the specific insights I gained throughout my time at DT and the valuable experiences that shaped me into a leader overseeing two teams, comprising five individuals.

My journey at DT began with my assignment to the Winning Culture Lab, a team entrusted with enhancing the learning experiences of all members while simultaneously optimizing the company's overall output. Mr. Nithin, my team leader, who introduced me to a foundational approach that had a profound impact on my approach to tasks.
Nithin's mentorship instilled in me a powerful strategy for effective problem-solving and decision-making - the 3Ws. This strategy required me to pose three essential questions before proceeding with any task:
Why: Why are we proceeding in this particular manner? What's the rationale behind our approach?
What: What outcomes are we aiming to achieve? What are the expected results?
Who: Who are the ultimate consumers of our efforts? Who will benefit from the results?
This approach fundamentally changed the way I approached tasks. By delving deep into these questions, I was able to establish a clear sense of purpose, anticipate potential challenges, and align my efforts with the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

During this time, I met our CEO, Mr. Tarun. He conducted an orientation session for all the students, during which he introduced us to the concept of DT pedagogy. He explained that this pedagogy involves using the Feynman Technique, as formulated by Richard Feynman. The aim is to present complex concepts in such a simple manner that even a 5-year-old could understand. To illustrate this, he used a straightforward example involving Karachi Bakery as a server, where the customers are analogous to users of the bakery's services.
Mr. Tarun emphasized the significance of elucidating concepts through easily understandable examples. He highlighted that this approach aids in prolonged retention of the concepts and also instills their value. For instance, while discussing space and time complexity, he demonstrated how improvements in these aspects could be equated to saving money. This angle captured the class's attention and kindled curiosity.
Moreover, Mr. Tarun demonstrated the art of selling dreams. He addressed all the students as future CTOs and CXOs of various companies. This strategy effectively engaged all the students and compelled them to attentively listen to his explanations.
At the end of the session he asked all of the moderators to share there reflections which is one of the crucial ritual at DT and he even explained the importance of reflection which is crucial for learning from experiences, fostering self-awareness, and making informed decisions for personal and professional growth.

My client at Deep Thought was Mr. Harsha, the secretary of St. Mary's Group of Institutions. He faced a critical challenge with the employee appraisal system.
Mr. Harsha sought to enhance the existing employee appraisal system, aiming to recognize hardworking employees while identifying those who were not meeting expectations. We collaborated to develop a three-phase approach that combined scientific metrics and comprehensive evaluation to ensure fairness and transparency.

The first phase focused on gathering preliminary insights into employees' responsibilities, time management, problem-solving skills, and more. We designed an application form with targeted questions that provided a holistic overview of each employee's contributions and work ethic.
In the second phase utilizing existing employee data, we devised a set of scientific metrics to evaluate performance objectively. These metrics considered factors such as productivity, task completion, and project outcomes. This data-driven approach helped eliminate bias and ensured consistent evaluations.
The final phase involved interviews with higher authorities, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of an employee's potential and contribution. 

During the presentation phase, we adopted the McKinsey Pyramid Principle to present our findings and recommendations. This approach involved presenting the conclusion upfront, followed by supporting arguments, and then substantiating data and facts. This method catered to the user perspective, helping Mr. Harsha quickly grasp the essence of the information shared.

By presenting the output first and then providing context and data, we ensured that Mr. Harsha was comfortable with the information and could comprehend it effectively. This approach facilitated informed decision-making and allowed us to gather valuable inputs from Mr. Harsha, enriching the final solution.

Later, I took on the responsibility of leading a new team in charge of recruitment. In our selection process, we initiated with a persona form, utilizing prompt engineering to assess the responses. This method involved crafting targeted prompts that guided candidates to provide specific and relevant answers. By designing prompts that highlighted the desired qualities and skills, we aimed to gain insights into candidates' suitability for the roles. This approach allowed us to efficiently evaluate candidates based on their responses, streamlining the selection process and ensuring a more informed decision-making process.

Prompt engineering involves crafting specific and context-rich prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant answers. To start, we defined our evaluation goal and created prompts with clear instructions and context. Specified the desired answer structure and consider including examples for clarity. Anticipate potential pitfalls and refine prompts based on AI-generated responses. We even Fine-tuned prompts iteratively for optimal outcomes. This process enables AI to consistently provide answers that align with your evaluation objectives.

Emotional intelligence is crucial as it enhanced my interpersonal skills, fostered effective communication, and promoted collaboration. During my tenure at the company, I had the invaluable opportunity to delve into the realm of emotional learning, a transformative experience that has left an indelible mark on my personal and professional growth. As I reflect on this journey, I am struck by the profound impact that understanding and harnessing emotions can have on both individual development and collective success.

Emotional learning, a cornerstone of emotional intelligence, became a focal point of my growth trajectory. It was through this process that I began to truly comprehend the significance of self-awareness, recognizing my emotions and their implications on my behavior and interactions. This newfound awareness laid the groundwork for self-regulation, granting me the ability to navigate challenges with a composed demeanor and make decisions with clarity rather than being swayed by fleeting emotions.

Perhaps the most resonating aspect of my emotional learning journey was the cultivation of empathy. The ability to put myself in others' shoes, understand their feelings, and respond with genuine compassion has not only enriched my relationships but has also fostered a sense of camaraderie and unity within our team. I've witnessed firsthand how empathy serves as a bridge, connecting individuals and fostering an environment of trust and understanding.

Emotional learning has also had a profound impact on my leadership journey. It has equipped me with the tools to foster a supportive and inclusive workplace culture. By recognizing and valuing the emotions of team members, I've been able to guide them through challenges, celebrate their successes, and cultivate an atmosphere where open communication and collaboration thrive.
As I contemplate the transformative influence of emotional learning, I am reminded that this journey is ongoing. It's a continual process of self-discovery, introspection, and growth. I am committed to nurturing these skills, not only for my personal advancement but also to contribute to the greater success of the teams I am privileged to lead.

In conclusion, my experience with emotional learning has been a pivotal chapter in my professional journey. It has bestowed upon me the power to navigate emotions, build meaningful relationships, and lead with empathy. I am deeply grateful for the company's dedication to fostering emotional intelligence, as it has not only enriched my life but has also positively impacted the dynamics of the workplace, creating an environment where individuals flourish and collaborate harmoniously.

During the later phases of our journey, we were introduced to a fundamental psychological concept that greatly broadened our understanding‚Äîthe Maslow Hierarchy of Needs. This concept, proposed by Abraham Maslow, delineates the different layers of human needs, guiding us to comprehend the intricate interplay between our motivations and aspirations.

The Maslow Hierarchy of Needs framework delineates a pyramid with five distinct tiers, each representing a specific category of human needs. At the base lie the physiological needs, encompassing necessities like food, water, and shelter. As we ascend the pyramid, we encounter safety needs, followed by the need for love and belonging, which emphasizes social connections and relationships. Further up, the pyramid features esteem needs, encompassing self-esteem and recognition, both from oneself and others. At the pinnacle, we find self-actualization‚Äîa state of realizing one's full potential and pursuing personal growth and fulfillment.

This framework profoundly resonated with our experiences and observations. It provided a lens through which we could comprehend our own motivations, as well as those of colleagues, acquaintances, and even clients. Witnessing the transformation of individuals from fulfilling their basic needs to striving for self-actualization was both enlightening and inspiring.
As we incorporated the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs into our approach, we found ourselves better equipped to address the diverse needs of our team members. Recognizing the significance of fostering an environment that supports personal and professional growth, we endeavored to create spaces that allowed individuals to ascend the pyramid and reach their full potential.

Moreover, this concept proved instrumental in our client interactions as well. It enabled us to comprehend their underlying motivations and tailor our solutions to address their distinct needs. Whether it was designing programs to meet the safety needs of teams during organizational transitions or fostering an environment of recognition and self-esteem, the insights derived from Maslow's hierarchy guided us in making more informed and impactful decisions.
In retrospect, our exposure to the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs marked a turning point in our journey. It instilled in us a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human motivations and aspirations. Armed with this newfound understanding, we were not only able to enhance our interactions within the workplace but also elevate the quality of our engagements with clients, making our journey one of continuous growth and enlightenment.

Towards the end of our journey, a recurring highlight was our weekly exposure to diverse business concepts. These sessions served as a vital platform for continuous learning and growth, enriching our understanding of the multifaceted business landscape.
Each week, our journey was enriched by the introduction of a new business concept, spanning a diverse array of topics. From brand positioning and finance to Design Thinking, product mindset, MVP (most viable product), and user-centric approaches, these sessions were instrumental in broadening our understanding of the multifaceted business landscape.

Through these immersive sessions, we gained insights into essential aspects of business strategy and execution. We explored how effective brand positioning can resonate with customers, learned the intricacies of finance and its impact on decision-making, and embraced the principles of Design Thinking to foster innovation. The concept of a product mindset taught us to focus on value creation, while the notion of MVP illuminated the path toward building and refining successful products. Finally, the user-centric approach underscored the importance of prioritizing customer needs and preferences.
Each concept was more than theoretical knowledge; it was a practical toolkit for navigating the complexities of the business world. Through case studies and real-world applications, we learned how to translate these concepts into actionable strategies that drive tangible results. The cumulative effect was a transformation of our thinking, enabling us to approach challenges and opportunities with a strategic and informed mindset.

These weekly sessions also fostered a culture of continuous learning and collaboration. We engaged in dynamic discussions, sharing perspectives, and drawing from the collective pool of knowledge. This not only deepened our understanding but also facilitated a holistic view of business, breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional insights.
Looking back, the introduction of these business concepts was pivotal in our growth journey. It equipped us with the tools to contribute effectively to the organization's success and navigate the ever-evolving business landscape. These concepts became a shared language that facilitated seamless communication and alignment across teams, ultimately enriching our decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.

our exposure to a diverse array of business concepts on a weekly basis was a dynamic and empowering component of our journey. It was a testament to the company's commitment to our development and readiness to equip us with the tools needed to excel in the ever-evolving landscape of business.

My time at Deep Thought has been an enriching journey that led me from being a humble learner to becoming a confident leader. The insights gained from the Deep Thought have been instrumental in shaping my leadership approach. As I reflect on this journey, I am truly grateful for the transformative experiences and the invaluable mentorship that have propelled me toward successful leadership. I look forward to carrying these lessons with me as I embrace new challenges and opportunities in the future.

15/08/2023, 15:59 - Omkar Arade: Introspection of DeepThought Journey:

Life has a funny way of surprising us, often when we least expect it. I remember stumbling upon DeepThought on Internshala, and a mix of feelings washed over me. I was curious, of course, wondering what this new place had to offer. But, there was also this hint of doubt in the back of my mind. I kept asking myself: 'Is this just a momentary distraction or is there something more meaningful here?' At that time, my main focus was an assessment I had lined up with Accenture, which felt like my safe zone. But the more I thought about DeepThought and the messages from chats, the more I felt a strong pull toward it. It seemed like there was something unique about the role they were offering. It wasn't just another job to me; it felt like the doorway to a new chapter in my life. This powerful feeling pushed me to speed up the interview process more than I had planned originally.

Have you ever walked into a massive library and picked up a book, only to find it's in a language you don't know? That's how I felt in my first three days of observation at DeepThought. It was this mix of excitement, a bit of confusion, and lots and lots of curiosity. Every day felt like a fresh learning experience. It was as if I was wearing the hat of both an archaeologist, digging for hidden knowledge, and a detective, trying to connect the pieces and find the bigger picture. Many evenings, I'd get so wrapped up in the session that I'd lose track of time. It was challenging, sure, but also so thrilling. I wasn't just trying to figure out a new culture; it felt like I was getting to know an entirely different world.

Missing that interview felt like a sudden splash of cold water. That's where Tarun came into the picture. With his guidance and understanding, I not only found comfort but also a new sense of direction and purpose. Working on the JSMIES project wasn't just a backup plan or a second option for me; it felt like a call to action. This wasn't just about the world of Data Science anymore; it reached out into the areas of society and education. It made me see that sometimes taking a different route can lead to even better, more rewarding places.

My first day at DDUJKY was something I'll never forget. The hackathon experience was led by Tarun, the CEO. It wasn't just about coding or solutions; it was about 'learning to learn,' diving deep into the very process of understanding.

At JSMIES, my first day gave me a glimpse into what was in store. It felt like stepping into a world where the approach to learning was given as much importance as the content itself. Here, I got introduced to two powerful ways of learning: the Feynman Technique and Socratic thinking. The Feynman Technique was all about breaking down complex ideas step by step, simplifying things so they could be easily understood. In contrast, Socratic thinking was all about asking the right questions, challenging what we know, and digging deeper.

But more than these techniques, it was about changing the way I looked at teaching. Instead of just passing on information, it was about guiding students on how to think, analyze, and understand. My views on education were slowly changing, and DDUJKY was the place that sparked that change, nudging me to look beyond the usual and explore innovation.

Stepping into the role of a mentor was like viewing the world with a fresh set of eyes. For years, I was used to being a student, always eager to grasp new information. But now, I was on the opposite side, tasked with guiding young minds. The weight of this new role was felt deeply. Each session was a balancing act: sharing knowledge, tuning into my students' needs, and tailoring my methods to best suit them.

In moments when I felt students were drifting or losing interest, I had a trick up my sleeve. At DeepThought, we had our unique set of drills. One of my favorites was 'Floodgates'. It involved intentionally giving wrong answers to questions. Sounds surprising, right? But the magic of this was how it removed fear from students. They realized it's okay to make mistakes but it's important to express ideas. Another fascinating drill was 'Spidear Web', where students would shout out random words, and the challenge was to weave all these words into a coherent sentence. This wasn't just about creativity in connecting dots; it was a brilliant exercise to sharpen their lateral thinking.

The Feynman and Socratic methods weren't just tools for me; they became my guiding principles in life. They shaped not only how I conducted my training classes but also how I viewed the world around me. Every single interaction with a student was a chance to learn something new. For example, when a student raised a question, it wasn't just a simple query. It gave me a peek into their thinking, their perspectives. This journey as a moderator was not only about intellectual growth. It was deeply rooted in understanding emotions and forming real bonds. It led to richer connections, deeper understanding, and personal growth.

Business, for me, was like stepping into a huge, unexplored forest where every path held a new lesson. At DeepThought, I got this wide, open view of how different things in business, like growth strategies, Finance, brand positioning, etc come together. It was like watching two worlds meet: the detailed and careful world of coding joining hands with the fast-paced world of business plans. Every single project felt like being back in school. It wasn't just about using my technical skills; it was about blending them with the broader stories that businesses tell. This gave me a complete, rounded view, showing me how to come up with solutions that looked at the whole picture.

Being at the helm of the M.Tech hiring initiative was both an opportunity and a challenge. It wasn't just about my skills, but about understanding people, their motivations, and their aspirations. As the team lead, and with my background as a behavioral data scientist, I was in a unique position to read between the lines. Compassion and understanding became my guiding stars. It was like walking on a tightrope ‚Äì I had to assign tasks carefully, making sure they matched each team member's strengths and areas of growth.

Every day, we had specific KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to achieve. But these weren't just numbers or targets; they painted a clear picture of where we were headed and what we needed to accomplish. At the end of the day, we had our 'Theory of Constraints (ToC) sessions. These were special moments where everyone came together. Each member opened up about their day, highlighting bottlenecks they faced and the achievements they celebrated. Together, as one cohesive unit, we would brainstorm, coming up with creative solutions and strategies to overcome any hurdles. It wasn't just about the work; it was about growing together as a team, understanding each other's challenges, and celebrating our collective success.

Stepping into the world of hostel life as a behavioral data scientist felt like discovering a new, lively village. Each corridor echoed with stories, each room held its secrets. Simple things, like joining in for a casual cricket match, became my window into understanding the students better. As we played and laughed, I could sense more than just the game. With every conversation, students began to share more. They spoke about their rooms, the food they ate, and their overall feelings about the hostel life. It wasn't just about gathering feedback for me; it was about truly listening. Instead of being a distant figure, I put myself in their shoes, feeling what they felt. By doing so, I not only connected with them but also gained deeper insights into their daily lives and concerns.

Our approach was comprehensive, aiming to touch every aspect of hostel life. Recognizing the importance of good food, we brought in a system where students could directly share their feedback with the chef. This not only improved the meals but also created a sense of community. Then there were the human data points, which provided us with deeper insights into the daily experiences of the students. Based on these, we made several changes. Introducing performance-based incentives also played a key role. This new approach motivated everyone, from wardens to chefs, to give their best, creating a more vibrant and dedicated community.

With the intention of reshaping the entire hostel culture, I focused on drafting distinct policies for both boys and girls. For boys, stringent measures were put in place to tackle issues like ragging. For the girls, our policies were crafted to empower them, ensuring they had equal access and felt confident to make full use of campus facilities, be it labs, libraries, or sports grounds. To foster a love for sports and extracurriculars, we introduced sports clubs. The aim was to create a holistic environment that nurtured both the mind and body.

The most significant shift was transitioning the hostels into dormitories. It wasn't just about a name change. It signified our vision of making these spaces more than just places to sleep. We envisioned them as hubs of learning, interaction, and personal growth.

At DeepThought, I truly understood the heart of teamwork. It wasn't just about what I achieved on my own but about what we accomplished together as a team. We celebrated each other's successes and tackled challenges side by side. It wasn't about one person shining, but about the whole team moving forward. Every project had its ups and downs, but with compassion, a clear common goal, and teamwork, we navigated through them. It made me realize that unity isn't just about being together; it's about working together, understanding each other, and aiming for the same destination.

Working at DeepThought was more than just clocking in and out; it was an adventure. Every day felt like a trek, navigating through the intricate landscapes of coding, exploring the diverse terrains of business, and climbing the peaks of leadership challenges. Yes, there were tough times, moments that tested my resilience. But then there were those bright moments too, where teamwork's joy and small victories lit up the way. I learned so much, from the seamless blend of technology with business to taking on leadership roles with confidence. Now, as I reflect on this journey, I'm filled with gratitude. These experiences didn't just shape my professional path; they played a big role in shaping who I am today.

"Mapping Out My Next Steps:

Reconnecting with Data Science:
Data science and I go way back, much like dear friends from school days. Even as I explored various areas at DeepThought, my bond with data remained intact. I aim to dive deeper, explore its vast oceans, and understand it even better. I know there's a lot more waiting for me, and my excitement only grows.

Delving Deeper into Business:
Business, to me, is a vast canvas with so many incomplete sketches. While at DeepThought, I managed to sketch out a few areas. However, there's much more to paint and understand. With every layer I add, the bigger picture becomes more apparent. I'm keen to blend my technical knowledge and get a better grasp of this expansive world.

Evolving in the Role of a Moderator:
Every session I moderate is a two-way street; I share knowledge, and in return, I learn. Tools like the Feynman Technique are just the beginning. There are numerous ways to guide and assist, and I am on a mission to discover them all. Being a moderator isn't just about the curriculum; it's about connecting with students at a deeper level.

Connecting with People:
One invaluable lesson from DeepThought: people are the core of everything. Beyond tasks and goals lie emotions, dreams, and aspirations. My journey has made me a better listener and given me the ability to connect on a human level. I aim to hone this skill further, believing it's the key to improving all interactions, whether work-related or casual chats.

Seeking Fresh Horizons:
The world is vast, filled with uncharted territories and challenges. I've tackled several at DeepThought, but now, I'm setting my eyes on new horizons. With my grounding in data science, I'm eager to venture into new domains, seeking problems and crafting solutions.

Committing to Personal Growth:
Every sunrise brings an opportunity to evolve. Be it acquiring a new skill, lending a helping hand, or relishing a quiet moment of introspection, I am committed to growth. I see every experience, be it joyous or challenging, as a teacher guiding my path.

In Conclusion:
My time at DeepThought has been a treasure trove of lessons and memories. As I gaze forward, these learnings are my companions. I'm ready for what's next, armed with experiences and driven by curiosity. My journey thus far has been enriching, and I'm optimistic about the road ahead."

Understanding My Writing's Roots:

"Have you ever paused and thought about the essence behind my words? Well, that essence was born in the nurturing environment of DeepThought. Every evening, after a day filled with work, I'd immerse myself in the beauty of poetry. These recitation sessions weren't merely about reading lines written on paper. It was a journey of emotions, where every word carried a weight, and every phrase conveyed a feeling of improving communication. When you read my narratives, you get a glimpse into those evenings where feelings took the shape of words, and those words painted vivid images

@‚Å®Harsha Sir‚Å© 

We see our investment just collapsing. I have been escalating the living conditions here. 

Our people are getting restless, underproductive. We don't feel valued at all. This is just exploitation. 

1- There was no drinking water in Rehab during the last two days 

2- They took out the water cooler outside SoftwareHub. They put a bubble inside counseling room, but none inside Software Hub 

3- The Dhobi never shows up, people are forced to wash their own clothes. This was escalated 3months back

4- The bathroom flushes are not working for 3months now, in Rehab. The hand faucets are not working. The water supply in the tap is very slow. 

5- The food is not at all nutritious. Vikram lost 7kgs of weight in 40days. I myself felt very week after staying for 4days, on campus.
[8/15, 11:39 PM] Tarun Sciensation: DeepThought team was supposed to work on the culture of the organization. Our own team morale is very low right now. 

We have been escalating to @‚Å®Bhargav Krishna‚Å© and yet the basic amenities are not in place. 

People are unable to think clearly, because they are worried about basic survival. 

What is the point of spoiling the future of these youngsters, who could have spent these two months doing a lot more productive work.

The water cans arrived. However Mr. Jeevan insists that Mr. Naresh permits the driver to drop the water cans at A2 building. Else they would have to drop it in the store and we would have to take it from the store on Monday

The driver took the initiative to drop the can at A2 block by collecting my signature on a paper. However the maintenance incharge insisted that Mr. Naresh informs this over a phone call.  

They took 3 days to get the cans and they are taking another 2days to give the cans. 

16 people are drinking water from one water can currently

1- There are not enough water cans
2- No one is refilling the water cans. The people are filling the water cans themselves and it is not a comfortable experience to life the water can and carry it to the second floor. 

This is not the experience we would like to create for our young techies. Drinking water is a basic necessity and a neglect towards this signal a very very negative message towards the people. 

We have lost about 10 people in the last 20 days due to poor hospitality.
[8/19, 9:24 PM] Phanindra Sir(Harsha Sir PA): Had a conference call with Satyanarayana sir, Tarun, Bhargav and discussed about the requirements for their employees. It is decided that henceforth, Tarun will inform Satyanarayana sir & me so that there wouldn‚Äôt be any delay in meeting the given requirement.
Also told Satyanarayana sir to simplify the purchase of the said items for them.

Please Note: There may be more than one answer possible. You have to identify the best possible approach and the right set of statements while arriving at the answer.

Calculate the amount of petrol sold for automobiles in Mumbai in a month (30 days)? (in million liters). Write numeric value only. For example, if the answer is 300 million liters, write 300.

1) Autos and buses in Mumbai run on CNG.

2) Petrol consumption of Mumbai currently is triple of that of Kolkata and half of that of Delhi. 3) Diesel consumption is 65% of the total fuel consumption at oil retail stations in Mumbai.

4) Petrol consumption in major metro cities in India has grown 3 to 4 times during the last decade.

5) The typical fuel efficiency of cars is around 15 km per liter and that of two wheeler is 60 km per liter.

6) Some of the automakers claim a fuel efficiency of 28 km/liter in India.

7) Daily petrol consumption for a year in Kolkata was around 1.5 million liters 10 years back.

8) 5% of car owners' households in Mumbai own two cars.

9) Oil retail stations in Mumbai sell CNG, Petrol, and Diesel only. 10) On an average, a car in Mumbai drives 500 km every month and
06/09/2023, 21:25 - Omkar Arade: To calculate the amount of petrol sold for automobiles in Mumbai in a month, we can use the following information:

2) Petrol consumption of Mumbai currently is triple that of Kolkata and half that of Delhi.
4) Petrol consumption in major metro cities in India has grown 3 to 4 times during the last decade.
5) The typical fuel efficiency of cars is around 15 km per liter.
10) On average, a car in Mumbai drives 500 km every month.

Let P be the petrol consumption in Kolkata (in million liters).

According to statement 2, the petrol consumption in Mumbai is triple that of Kolkata, so it's 3P.

According to statement 5, the typical fuel efficiency of cars is 15 km per liter. So, the average car in Mumbai would require (500 km / 15 km per liter) = 33.33 liters of petrol per month.

Now, we need to calculate the number of cars in Mumbai. Let C be the number of cars.

According to statement 10, on average, a car in Mumbai drives 500 km every month. So, the total distance driven by all cars in Mumbai is 500 km per car * C cars.

Now, we can equate this to the amount of petrol consumed:

(500 km per car * C cars) / 15 km per liter = 3P

Solving for C:

C = (3P * 15 km per liter) / 500 km per car

Now, we need to consider statement 8:

8) 5% of car owners' households in Mumbai own two cars.

So, the number of car-owning households with two cars is 5% of the total car-owning households.

Let H be the total number of car-owning households.

5% of H own two cars, so (5/100) * H = (1/20) * H own two cars.

Now, we can calculate the number of cars owned by these households:

Number of cars = (1/20) * H * 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of cars in Mumbai:

Total cars in Mumbai = C + (1/20) * H * 2

Now, we have the total number of cars in Mumbai, and we know that each car requires 33.33 liters of petrol per month.

Total petrol consumption = Total cars in Mumbai * 33.33 liters

This will give us the amount of petrol sold for automobiles in Mumbai in a month (in million liters).

Please note that we need additional information from the statements or external data to determine the values of P (petrol consumption in Kolkata) and H (total number of car-owning households in Mumbai). Without this information, we cannot provide a specific numeric answer.
06/09/2023, 21:26 - Ashokanand DT: 6) Some of the automakers claim a fuel efficiency of 28 km/liter in India.

7) Daily petrol consumption for a year in Kolkata was around 1.5 million liters 10 years back 8) 5% of car owners' households in Mumbai own two cars.

9) Oil retail stations in Mumbai sell CNG, Petrol, and Diesel only.

10) On an average, a car in Mumbai drives 500 km every month and a two-wheeler drives 30 km every month.

11) CNG consumption in Mumbai per day is 29.5 million liters.

12) There are 30 million households in Mumbai.

13) 30% of households own at least one Car and 60% own a two-wheeler in Mumbai.

14) Cars and two-wheelers are the main automotive which consume petrol in Mumbai.

15) Mumbai residents and businesses on an average typically consume 90 million liters of petrol and diesel together a day.

16) Travelers entering Mumbai by road in their own cars consume around 0.5 million liters of petrol only every day in Mumbai.

06/09/2023, 21:27 - Omkar Arade: To calculate the amount of petrol sold for automobiles in Mumbai in a month (30 days), let's use the additional information provided:

We'll still start by calculating the total number of cars in Mumbai using statement 8 and statement 13.

First, calculate the total number of households owning cars and two-wheelers:

Total households in Mumbai = 30 million (from statement 12)
Car-owning households = 30% of households (from statement 13)
Two-wheeler owning households = 60% of households (from statement 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of cars and two-wheelers:

Number of cars in Mumbai = Total households * Car-owning percentage
Number of two-wheelers in Mumbai = Total households * Two-wheeler-owning percentage

Now, we need to calculate the monthly petrol consumption for cars and two-wheelers in Mumbai:

For cars:
Monthly petrol consumption per car = (500 km per car / 15 km per liter) = 33.33 liters
Total monthly petrol consumption for cars = Number of cars * Monthly petrol consumption per car

For two-wheelers:
Monthly petrol consumption per two-wheeler = (30 km per two-wheeler / 60 km per liter) = 0.5 liters
Total monthly petrol consumption for two-wheelers = Number of two-wheelers * Monthly petrol consumption per two-wheeler

Now, add the petrol consumption for cars and two-wheelers to find the total monthly petrol consumption for automobiles in Mumbai.

Total monthly petrol consumption for automobiles = Total monthly petrol consumption for cars + Total monthly petrol consumption for two-wheelers

Finally, round the result to the nearest whole number to get the answer in million liters.

Please note that we have all the necessary information to calculate the answer, and it doesn't require the data about CNG consumption or daily petrol consumption for a year in Kolkata (statements 11 and 7).

A majority of the jobs in today's economy requires a professional degree. However, many such jobs do not require knowledge gained from those degrees. For employees in such jobs, basic skills in computer, good communication skills, and decent problem-solving ability, play an important role in their performance. Hence, demanding a professional degree from the job seekers is not fair.

Which of the following, if true, weakens the conclusion of the argument above?

The skills mentioned in the argument play an important role in developing a career in today's economy.

The majority of the new jobs require skills that can be gained from the knowledge imparted in a professional degree.

Social work with noble aims requires coordination of many people who are equally motivated for their cause.

Social workers tend not to respect politicians who are interested in

improving society.

Social workers believe that those who are politicians are not motivated to

do social work.

Politicians can improve society as much as a social worker does.

Usually, social workers enter the field with a noble aim of improving society and respect as true companions for all those who work with a similar intention. Therefore, when any social worker enters politics to improve society, most other social workers conclude that the politician should no longer be respected as a true companion.

The explanation offered above for the low esteem shown to social worker-turned politicians assumes that:

A lie detector, or polygraph, monitors several physical reactions in the person undergoing the test. Befooling a lie detector test is quite easy. A small dose of a widely used over the counter stress-busting drug can allow a person to lie during lie detection tests without being caught.

22/09/2023, 23:32 - santosh (DT): Thanks for your time Santosh. I am doing an exercise with existing folks today. I think this may be a good exercise so we are fair to everyone. 

I am sharing it with you and would love to get your inputs aswell
--

I am writing this message to help you conduct an internal exercise for your career. 
You may rate yourself on a scale of 10. You need not share it with me, but you could do this exercise for yourself

1- Do you see value in teaching, is it helping you develop your personality and your approach to your technical domain?

2- Do you see value in the DT L&D drills. Do you find a connection between the psychological concepts and your domain?

3- Do you find clarity with respect to your career? Do you see DT helping you advance ahead in your career?

4- Do you find substance in the DT drills for imbibing strategy and policy level thinking, leadership development? Do you see yourself gaining from it?

5- Do you find yourself improving everyday or do you see yourself getting drained out?


*If your score is 30/50 or more*
I'm happy to discuss more and help you get more out of DT

*If your score is 20/50 or less*
We can break ties amicably, we shall not impose the liquidated damages clause. 


DT has a dream, very few may connect with it today
You would be able to grow here, if you connect with it
Else, I'm sure you have grown enough to find other opportunities and flourish

This is a national mission, to strengthen our education
as well as the corporate system with young leaders
This mission gets the best chances with youngsters who believe in the cause

So, pls do score yourself
Happy to help you irrespective of what you score yourself

Good night!
